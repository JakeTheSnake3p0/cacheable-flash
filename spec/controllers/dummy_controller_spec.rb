# Controller specs do not hit the full rails stack, and Middleware is ignored.
# For this reason testing in the controller must rely on the around filter,
# even if you are actually using the Middleware in your actual app
# The DummyController in the dummy app includes CacheableFlash to make the helpers testable as a controller spec.
